# Heart disease prediction

This project aims to use a dataset containing information about individuals to predict whether a person is prone to a heart attack or not.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **id**: Unique identifier for the individual (int).
- **gender**:  Gender of the individual (string).
- **age**: Age of the individual (int).
- **hypertension**: Whether the individual has hypertension (0 if no, 1 if yes; bool).
- **heart_disease**: Whether the individual has heart disease (0 if no, 1 if yes; bool).
- **ever_married**: Whether the individual has ever been married (string).
- **work_type**: Type of employment (string).
- **residence_type**: Type of residence (string).
- **avg_glucose_level**: Average blood glucose level (float).
- **bmi**: BMI index of the individual (float).
- **smoking_status**: Whether the individual smokes (string).
- **stroke**: Whether the individual is prone to a heart attack (1 if yes, 0 if no; bool). This is the target variable that the model needs to predict.

## Algorithms

In this project, various algorithms were used for training the model:

- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**
- **Neural networks**
